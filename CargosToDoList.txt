Cargo's Note List

~9 HBSBT damage per kilogram of TNT equivilent 

Arty shell aprox damage calc theory:

1000/[shots per ton]/2/3*9, half propellent half charge, 30% of force heads toward nearby object, 9 upconversion as above.

1000/shots*1.5=AOE damage

works for Thumper. Either sniper/longtom ammo per ton or damage is wrong.

Replace Exponent evasion pips algebra problem traits with statements of effect. eg. 
    "{0} Recoil Per Evasion Pip" vs "Recoil Change based on your evasion. Base Recoil multiplied by: Number of Evasion Pips to the power of {0}",
    This is mostly straightforward, Heavy Gauss is 1 recoil per pip for example. Some weirdness with select fire weapons like RAC.
    
Make sure an Explodium trait is on every damage on jam weapon

Orion X has wrong description

Do APCs need unit_lance tags?

Finish my Flashpoint

Increase cash bonuses from contract secondary objectives. - Escort, Defend, Ambush, Destroy Base,  done

Does Tanker defender trait do anything? what's up with guarded/entrenched and vehicles?

Work on VTOL List <--- Slightly deprecated while Raza is in a vee making mood

Figure out and do things with Target Acquisition

Vultures are too small? Stormcrows possibly too big.

Disorderly Withdrawl
    If you don't get to the evac Sumire says she won't be able to pick you up for another X rounds. This is not true, the zone remains active.
    You can keep re-clicking Withdraw even after it changes to say "In X Rounds" and it will reset the timer each time.
    Does the actual zone on map have anything to do with the delay sumire talks about?
    Is MC and DW conflicting?
    What exactly is going on???

Check TAG and NARC stacking, what should stack what shouldn't and how will the player know.

Reworded objectives could make a Destroy Base or Rescue where *not* destroying the enemy units was a goal. Strongly negative cash for killing the lance. Forcing players to do the primary and extract

Shakedown by port authority event

We have a prefab for the Union dropship. it could be used in contracts as a building/turret.

Reputation effects on contract objectives.

The Arano mission with the APCs coming to take the base might be too hard.

More traits for TAC info?
